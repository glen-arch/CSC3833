In the first graph the data shows that the location of a house is far more influential on its price
than the type of house. This is shown as the most expensive type of house a detached house in
Newcastle still ends up being less expensive than the least expensive type of house a flat in
London. As well as this they will notice that the difference in price between Newcastle and London
has been slowly growing since 2001. The viewer will then be able to see that the types of housing
keep roughly the same relative value regardless of location. The viewer will also notice that
house prices have been continuously on the rise apart from a dip after the housing crisis in 2008.

In the second graph the viewer will first notice that for most places there is a very strong
correlation between upload and download speeds. The viewer will then notice that there are 2
outliers which are York and Hull which don't fit this trend. They will then notice the line of best
fit and see that despite Hull being an outlier it still fits the trend as its upon the line of best
fit. They will then see just how much of an outlier York is due to its incredibly high upload speeds.


In the third graph the viewer will notice that the stock price on average has been increasing since
1984. The viewer will then notice the Bollinger bands and see that they spike at certain points
indicating market volatility. The viewer will then notice that due to crashes the increase in stock
price from 2000-2021 was far less than the increase from 1984-2000. Due to the Bollinger bands
the viewer will be able to understand this is due to 1984-2000 having a far more stable market.
